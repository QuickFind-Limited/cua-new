# Execution Starting on Wrong Page - Analysis

## Problem
When executing the automation, it starts on a logout page instead of the sign-in page specified in the Intent Spec.

## Root Causes
1. **Browser Session Persistence**: The WebView might be retaining cookies/session from previous runs
2. **Missing Initial Navigation**: The Intent Spec might not include the initial `page.goto()` step
3. **Pre-flight Skip Logic**: The system might detect you're "already logged in" and skip login steps

## Solutions

### 1. Ensure Intent Spec Includes Initial Navigation
The first step in any Intent Spec should be:
```javascript
{
  "name": "Navigate to login page",
  "snippet": "await page.goto('https://accounts.zoho.com/signin?servicename=ZohoInventory')",
  "prefer": "snippet",
  "fallback": "none"
}
```

### 2. Clear Session Before Execution
Add session clearing in `enhanced-flow-executor.ts`:
```typescript
// Clear cookies and storage before starting
await page.context().clearCookies();
await page.context().clearPermissions();
```

### 3. Force Fresh Start
In `enhanced-magnitude-controller.ts`, before connecting:
```typescript
// Navigate to blank page first to clear state
await page.goto('about:blank');
// Then proceed with the flow
```

### 4. Check Pre-flight Analysis
The pre-flight analyzer might be incorrectly detecting state. Check `preflight-analyzer.ts`:
- Ensure it's not skipping the login step thinking you're already logged in
- The logout page might be misidentified as "logged in" state

## Immediate Workaround
1. Clear browser data/cookies manually before running
2. Ensure the recording starts from the sign-in page
3. Check that the Intent Spec's first step is navigation to the sign-in URL

## Code Changes Needed
1. Add explicit navigation to starting URL as first step
2. Clear session/cookies before execution starts
3. Improve state detection to distinguish logout page from logged-in state
