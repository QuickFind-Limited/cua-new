# CDP Screenshot Capture Implementation Test Guide

## Implementation Summary

We've successfully implemented Solution 3 for capturing screenshots when the Playwright stop button is clicked:

### Key Changes Made:

1. **CDP Connection**: 
   - Playwright launches with `--remote-debugging-port=9223`
   - App connects to browser via CDP 3 seconds after launch
   - Finds and connects to the main page (not DevTools)

2. **Stop Button Detection**:
   - Injects JavaScript into the browser page
   - Monitors for stop button clicks in Playwright toolbar
   - Detects buttons with `aria-label="Stop"` or `title="Stop"`
   - Uses MutationObserver to catch dynamically added buttons

3. **Screenshot Capture**:
   - Captures immediately when stop button is clicked
   - Uses CDP's `page.screenshot()` method
   - Saves as `{sessionId}-success.png` in recordings folder

4. **UI Updates**:
   - Shows "Begin Analysis" button immediately after stop click
   - No need to close Playwright browser
   - User can keep browser open for reference

5. **Edge Case Handling**:
   - If stop button clicked: Screenshot captured, UI updated
   - If browser closed without stop: No screenshot (correct behavior)
   - Cleanup properly disconnects CDP connection

## Testing Instructions

### Manual Test Steps:

1. **Start the Electron App**:
   ```bash
   cd electron-app
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Launch Playwright Recorder**:
   - Click "Launch Recorder" button in the app
   - Wait for Playwright browser and inspector to open

3. **Check CDP Connection** (in app console):
   - Should see: `[CDP] Attempting to connect to Playwright browser...`
   - Should see: `[CDP] Successfully connected to browser on port 9223`
   - Should see: `[CDP] Stop button detection script injected successfully`

4. **Record Some Actions**:
   - Navigate to a website
   - Click some elements
   - Fill out a form

5. **Click Stop Button**:
   - Click the stop button in Playwright's floating toolbar (under URL bar)
   - Should see in console: `[CDP] Stop button clicked detected!`
   - Should see: `[CDP] Screenshot captured successfully: recordings/recording-XXX-success.png`

6. **Verify UI Update**:
   - App should immediately show "Begin Analysis" button
   - No need to close Playwright browser
   - Recording file should be complete with closing brackets

7. **Verify Screenshot**:
   - Check `recordings` folder for `recording-XXX-success.png`
   - Screenshot should show the exact state when stop was clicked

### Automated Test:

Run the CDP test script:
```bash
node test-cdp-capture.js
```

This will:
- Check if CDP is accessible
- Connect to the browser
- Monitor for screenshot creation
- Verify the file exists and is recent

## Known Behaviors

### Working:
- ✅ CDP connection to Playwright browser
- ✅ Stop button detection via injected script
- ✅ Screenshot capture on stop click
- ✅ Immediate UI update to show "Begin Analysis"
- ✅ Browser can remain open after recording

### Edge Cases:
- If browser closed without stop: No screenshot (intended)
- If stop clicked multiple times: Only one screenshot (handled)
- If recording restarted: New session created (needs testing)

## Technical Details

### CDP Port: 9223
We use port 9223 to avoid conflicts with other Chrome instances.

### Stop Button Detection:
We detect clicks on elements matching:
- `[aria-label*="Stop"]`
- `[title*="Stop"]`  
- `[title*="stop"]`
- `button:has(.codicon-stop-circle)`

### Console Communication:
The injected script logs `PLAYWRIGHT_STOP_CLICKED` which the CDP listener detects.

### File Structure:
- Recording: `recording-{timestamp}.spec.ts`
- Screenshot: `recording-{timestamp}-success.png`

## Next Steps

1. Test with different websites and recording scenarios
2. Verify screenshot comparison with execution results
3. Handle recording restart scenario
4. Add error recovery if CDP connection fails
5. Consider adding progress indicator during CDP connection
