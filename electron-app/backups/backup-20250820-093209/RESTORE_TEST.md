# Full Restore Capability Test

## Critical Files for Full Restore

### ✅ Source Code
- [x] main/ directory (all TypeScript files)
- [x] ui/ directory (HTML, CSS, JS files)  
- [x] flows/ directory (flow types and management)

### ✅ Configuration Files
- [x] package.json - Node dependencies
- [x] package-lock.json - Exact dependency versions
- [x] tsconfig.json - TypeScript configuration
- [x] webpack.config.js - Build configuration
- [x] playwright.config.ts - Playwright configuration
- [x] .env - Environment variables (API keys)
- [x] .gitignore - Git ignore rules
- [x] preload.js - Electron preload script

### ✅ Documentation
- [x] All *.md files - Documentation

### ✅ Test Data
- [x] Recording specs (*.spec.ts)
- [x] Screenshots (*.png)

### ❌ NOT Included (Must be regenerated)
- [ ] node_modules/ - Run `npm install` after restore
- [ ] dist/ or build/ - Run `npm run build` after restore
- [ ] .git/ - Git history (not needed for code restore)
- [ ] recordings/.playwright-profile/ - Browser profile (regenerated)

## Full Restore Instructions

```bash
# 1. Create fresh electron-app directory
mkdir electron-app-restored
cd electron-app-restored

# 2. Copy ALL files from backup
cp -r ../electron-app/backups/backup-20250820-093209/* ./
cp ../electron-app/backups/backup-20250820-093209/.env ./
cp ../electron-app/backups/backup-20250820-093209/.gitignore ./

# 3. Install dependencies
npm install

# 4. Build TypeScript files
npm run build

# 5. Test the application
npm start
```

## Verification Checklist

After restore, verify:
- [ ] `npm install` completes without errors
- [ ] `npm run build` compiles TypeScript successfully
- [ ] `npm start` launches the Electron app
- [ ] "Launch Recorder" button works
- [ ] Recording and analysis features function
- [ ] All API keys in .env are present

## What Would Break Without These Files

Without **package.json**: 
- Cannot install dependencies
- Cannot run any npm scripts

Without **package-lock.json**:
- Different versions of dependencies might be installed
- Potential compatibility issues

Without **tsconfig.json**:
- TypeScript compilation would fail
- Cannot build the project

Without **.env**:
- No API keys for Claude/Anthropic
- LLM features would fail

Without **preload.js**:
- Electron IPC communication breaks
- Renderer can't communicate with main process

Without **webpack.config.js**:
- Build process would fail
- Cannot bundle the application

## Conclusion

✅ **YES, this backup IS sufficient for full restore** (after running npm install)

The backup contains all source code and configuration needed to fully rebuild the application from scratch, without requiring any git files.
