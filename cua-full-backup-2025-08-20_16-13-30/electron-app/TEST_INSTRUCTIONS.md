# Testing Analysis Feature

## Instructions to test the analysis:

1. **Record some actions**:
   - Click the red "Record" button in the toolbar
   - Navigate to any website (e.g., google.com)
   - Type something in the search box
   - Click the "Stop" button

2. **Trigger Analysis**:
   - After stopping the recording, an "Analyze" button should appear
   - Click the "Analyze" button
   - The sidebar should show and start the analysis

3. **Check Console Output**:
   - Watch the terminal where the app is running
   - You should see these debug messages:
     - `IPC: llm:analyzeRecording called`
     - `Starting analyzeRecordingWithMetadata...`
     - `getQueryFunction called`
     - `Starting worker process at:`
     - `Worker process is ready`

## If Analysis Doesn't Start:

The debug logs will help identify where the issue is:
- If no "IPC: llm:analyzeRecording" message appears, the button click isn't reaching the main process
- If "Worker process timeout" appears, the Claude Code SDK worker isn't starting
- If "Invalid recording data" appears, the recording format is incorrect

## Current Status:

✅ Tab bar and URL bar visibility fixed (using margin-left transitions)
✅ Collapse button simplified (now just hides sidebar)
✅ Claude Code SDK worker process implemented
✅ Debug logging added to trace execution flow
